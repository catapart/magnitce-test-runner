# Warning - Non-production package
This project is being prepared for production, but is not ready to be used as a dependency for anything. There will be breaking changes and unrecoverable states. Do not use until this warning has been removed.

When the library reaches the `1.0.0` designation, that will be a production package. From that point, you can use the major version number (`1` in `1.0.0`) to recognize when breaking changes are introduced.
